## Why to use Indiedev
The reasons are all the same than with the older version but with added features :)

This app is intended to be used by indie game developers who can share their work in progress games on the platform to get & give feedback about their projects. This way indie game developers can get valuable game testing feedback in the work in progress state. This allows for discovery of potential bugs in the game way sooner when they are still easy to fix and don't ruin the imago of the game by being released all buggy. The game testing feedback also reveals what is good in the game and what parts of the game still need improving/rework.

The other good side of using this app is that it lets developers to comment each others projects, plan ideas and planned price of the game way before full release of their games. This helps the lauch of the game go as smoothly as possible with the best price, development roadmap and quality of the game possible.
